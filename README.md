ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Matthew1231A, a Computer Science student based in Blacksburg, Virginia at Virginia Tech.

I'm interested in backend engineering, autonomous systems, and robotics (despite it not being 100% in my degree path...)

Many of the repositories on my profile are private due to them containing code for classes which I cannot publicly expose.

Away from the keyboard I like to cook, listen to music, bike, and read.

Got an idea for a cool project or just a random tangent you'd like to discuss? You can reach me at mattn (at) vt.edu.

Thanks! Matt N.
